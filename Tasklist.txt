4180 Task List:
	-Line Detection 
		input: line color
		output: direction to turn, "strength" of turn
	-Map design and printout (on large format printer)
		3 paths (one red, one green, one blue)
		45 degree bends (or curved bends) in all turns (i.e., no hard turns)
		Paths cross at 90 degree angles
		keep paths relatively spaced out. 
		thin path lines (~1/8" to ~1/4")
		All paths come from same start location, go to different end locations. 
		Paths "end" in a box of same path color
		size of map: 10' x 10' (too big?)
	-Sonar Interface (through mbed)
		output: output distance for each sonar device
	-Robot Gripper
		physical test
		electrical test
	-IR code detector
		output: "mode" code (differnt number based on what button on IR remote is pressed)
